This research program has a singular goal: embrace Everett's principle of quantum universality, apply quantum mechanics to the entire universe, and bootstrap to the exact form of the wave function of the universe. Everett's work on the foundations of quantum theory has been described by Max Jammer, a philosopher of science, as "**one of the most daring and most ambitious theories ever constructed in the history of science**." Three (radically conservative) fundamental assumptions are made: 1) that the universe is quantum on all scales, 2) that the total-energy of the universe is exactly zero, and 3) that the *form* of the laws of physics remain unchanged on all scales. All papers attempt to work out the observable consequences of these principles, and dares to answer some of the deepest questions humanity has ever asked.

## This program needs an institutional home!

I love taking risks. That's why I left the academy to pursue this program. When I graduated in 2015 with a degree in mathematical physics from Utah State, the dogma that is the Copenhagen interpretation was still in full-force. There was no obvious career path at the interection of quantum foundations and cosmology. And certainly no path that would tolerate my complete lack of risk aversion. So I left and stayed true to myself, daring to do the impossible.

### Help wanted

There are *many* open problems in the program, some more technically challenging than others. Perhaps the most impactful place to make a contribution is solving the final equation in [The Everettian Conformal Bootstrap](https://github.com/mayabenowitz/Origins/blob/main/manuscript/everettian_conformal_bootstrap_PRL.pdf) paper. In fact, you may falsify the theory if you find the Einstein field equations for the dual vacuum stress-energy tensor (which has the equation of state for dark matter) doesn't fit with observation! Or you might find just the opposite. 

## Open Source Science

This research program practices a radical form of open source science. Anyone can contribute. If an error is found in one of the manuscripts **please** open an issue and feel free to discuss with others with similar takes. While I can't promise to address every issue raised, I will do my best. If you have well-fleshed comments or rebuttals please, feel free to open a Pull Request (PR) with your submission!

***At this time, there are no guidelines for submission. (This is the Wild West of research at the knife's edge.) I strongly encourage subject matter experts with the desire to write a referee report to do so and open a PR.***

If you want to contribute (in either a technical capacity or an artistic one) to the program and/or collaborate on future papers please reach out! I've left most of the theory open. There are no shortage of calculations that can be done. Many of these calculations could even falsify the theory, or, lead to consequences that either have been or will be observed.

### Contribution policy

The speech here is nearly unrestricted. If something gets you fired up and spicy, feel free to be combative (within reason). If you are anonymous and an asshole, I will view you with great suspicion and reserve the right to let you taste the ban hammer. If you are an asshole and *not* anonymous, I can respect that.
