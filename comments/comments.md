## Stanford Postdoc in Quantum Gravity 07/02/2023

Thank you very much for taking the time to make some comments on the paper. I appreciate you! While I don't entirely agree with some of the comments in the motivation section, they are no hill I am willing to die on, so I am not inlcuding them below. For the sake of argument, I will concede you these. 

Page 3: equation 1.3: $\hat{H} \Psi = 0$

comment: "I am skeptical that there should be a notion of "energy" that is globally defined. Having a reparameterization or diffeomorphism invariant system will lead to an equation that looks somewhat like this, but the interpretation is quite different from saying that the energy is zero..."

response: "The most basic conflict between QM and GR is their mutually inconsistent definitions of energy (resp. time). Energy in GR is defined only for geometries that asymptotically approach a well-defined metric tensor at infinity. In QM, energy is defined by the time-translation symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Further still, the time reparameterization invariance of GR means the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ vanishes on physical states with compact geometries. If QM is universal (the first fundamental assumption) then there must exist a global defintion of energy for self-consistency."

Page 6: equation 2.1: $\left( \frac{-\hbar^2}{2M}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial a^2} + \frac{\hbar^2}{2M}g^{ij}R_{ij} \right)\Psi = 0$

comment: "When we're in the semiclassical regime, this equation has to boil down to the standard friedmann equation with all matter+dm sources turned on no? As it stands, it seems not to."

response: "We are **not** in the semiclassical regime here. In fact, we are **never** in the semiclassical regime in accordance to the principle of quantum universality -- that is, the universe is quantum on all scales. We are working from first principles to apply quantum theory to the entire universe. The purpose of this program is to work out the observable consequences of the stated principles and emerge spacetime and the field content of SM + whatever else is required for internal consistency. Before one can reach the Friedmann equation one needs to 1) derive a scheme to explain how classicality emerges and 2)
*derive* GR from the wave function of the universe. This is setup in the last section of the paper."


Page 6: "Equation (2.1) is far from the whole story, yet one reads off an unambiguous prediction:
the **Universe is spatially flat**."

comment: "This isn't quite a statement that seems consistent with spacetime covariance. In a concordence model like LCDM that rests on covariant laws of GR, we can say that the most parsimonious explanation is that we're witnessing a zero spatial curvature soltuion to otherwise covariant equations, but even there, nothing in the data says the spatial universe can't acually have a really small curvature scale that's too arge compared to our cosmic horizon radius. I'm just saying that privileging space, as opposed to spacetime, as a key feature of the underlying laws has to be done carefully."

response: "There is nothing inconsistent with vanishing spatial curvature (i.e., k=0 in the Friedmann equation) and the principle of general covariance. I can choose any coordinate system I like in Euclidean 3-space and the laws will be the same. Moreover, GR is a consequence of general covariance, the equivalence principle, and Lorentz invariance. The Friedmann equation is a solution to the EFEs. GR would be internally inconsistent if your statement was true. Lastly, we **observe** the universe to be spatially flat to within the 1% level today. Extrapolating back to the Planck era, this means the universe had to be perfectly flat to within one part in $10^{62}$. The most parasimonious explanation of any observation comes from first principles."

Page 6: equation 2.1 again.

comment: "I don't quite think the minisuperspace like equation has enough structure to truly explain the kinds of phenomena this section is alluding to."

response: "Not only does it not have enough structure it is **inconsistent**. To solve for the potential I assumed $\Psi$ takes the form of a power-law. There is no unitary evolution in equation 2.1! How can one normalize a power-law over all space? This is the key technical hurdle that must be overcome. This section is labeled the **cosmological information paradox** precisely because information is lost at the singularity and infinity. The rest of the paper developes the mathematical technology, or rather, deduces it from the principles to solve the paradox."

Page 9: "Something from nothing is inconsistent with unitarity."

comment: "Unitarity is a worry when notions of probability are relevant. If you have one wavefunction for the whole universe, only in subregions is there a meaningful concern about probabilities of repetable experiments etc. For the universe as a whole, unitarity is much harder to argue the need for don't you think?"

response: No. Without unitarity quantum theory is nonsense and you can predict precisely nothing!

comment: "I like the goemetry down here, and given that I have indicated my gripes above, I don't feel the need to re-iterate them here, so I'll leave this section relatively comment free. Even if you grant me the above criticisms, this very well could be a simplified model of something and the question in my opinion is what that something is."

response: "lol. I think I made it clear what I am calculating. :)"

Page 17: "The theory predicts Euclidean 3-space is graviationally charged with $m_{\infty}$"

comment: "This is somewhat at odds with the fact that closed universes, classically at least, have no gravitational charges!"

response: "This isn't a classical theory..."
